# Minimal Streamable Torrents CLI

This shit is so not finished

It basically is a daemon that downloads torrents for you and a cli client that does fancy stuff with the daemon.
So u know you can leave the application and it still is downloading wawi mami

This'll probably be in dev for some time cause i'm very lazy

This project is made only for fun, feel free to contribute if you feel like it
